# capstone-aws
I followed the instructions and was excited to take the given code 
And change the Index.html file and observed the changes.
I created a repository on GitHub and updated the HTML file and observed the changes.
At one point I had trouble connecting to Github and changed to SSH to connect to GitHub.
After cloning the repository I pushed my code.
I had trouble with the HTML file changing until I forced it. 
I then containerized the web application using Docker.
After this I started an EC2 instance and set up permissions and deployed it.
I then tested to see if the app was accessible over the internet.
After this I created AWS Cloud Formation using the given template.
I had challenged with the yaml file and changing it to work.
